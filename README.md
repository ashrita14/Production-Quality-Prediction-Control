Control Charts and Quality Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on implementing control charts to monitor process stability and predict product quality using statistical analysis and machine learning. The notebook covers both the conceptual understanding and practical application of control charts using simulated data. Additionally, predictive models are developed to forecast product quality based on historical data.

Objectives
Control Charts Implementation: Illustrate how control charts can monitor process stability and identify variations using random data.
Quality Prediction: Apply advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models to predict the quality of products within a dataset, optimizing production processes and providing actionable insights.
Project Structure
Introduction: Overview of control charts, their types, and significance.
Control Charts Implementation: Detailed step-by-step construction of control charts using random datasets to demonstrate how they detect process variations.
Quality Prediction Analysis: Exploration of statistical models to forecast product quality using regression techniques and data analysis.
Methodologies
Control Charts:
Utilizes X-bar, R, and other control charts.
Tracks process control limits, average process performance, and identifies outliers.
Quality Prediction:
Leverages regression models and statistical techniques to predict product quality metrics.
Includes feature engineering and model evaluation to ensure high accuracy.
How to Use
